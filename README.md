# realtime-sales-pipeline
This project implements an end-to-end streaming data pipeline designed to ingest, process, and visualize sales transactions in real-time. By moving away from traditional batch processing, this system provides sub-second visibility into sales performance, lead conversion rates, and revenue forecasts.
